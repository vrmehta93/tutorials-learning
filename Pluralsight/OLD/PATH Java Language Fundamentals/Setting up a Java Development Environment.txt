2.3 - Demo: Installing the JDK (Installing and Running Java)

	Download latest JDK
	Setup JAVA_HOME variable
	Update PATH variable
	Verify correct installation
	jdk.java.net

2.4 - Installing the JDK on macOS or Linux
	On other platforms, the process is actually similar; you download JDK, unpack it, put it into a well-known location, update JAVA_HOME and PATH variables to point to the right JDK directories
	On macOS, alternative - package manager Homebrew
		brew tap homebrew/cask-versions
		brew cask install java
	On Linux, you can perform the exact same steps
	If you're running Ubuntu Linux, then it's also possible to use their native package manager to install the JDK
		apt update
		apt install openjdk-13-jdk
		update-alternatives --config java	// useful if you want to install multiple versions of the JDK and switch between them
