2.9 - Introducing Packages (Creating Your First Java App)
	Packages provide organization
	Follow standard naming convention - ensures packages names are unique
	Affect source code structure
	Naming conventions
		All lowercase
		Use reverse domain name notation to assure global uniqueness
		Add further qualifiers to assure uniqueness within a company or group
	Type Names are qualified by their package

2.10 - Using Packages
	Package name affects how you run from cmd
	If you open cmd from (base directory is project folder) "./out/production/{project name}" folder, to run the Main.class file that's located in com/pluralsight/organized folder, execute "java com.pluralsight.organized.Main"

7.8 - StringBuilder
	The StringBuilder class provides a mutable string buffer. Remember that strings are immutable and that meant that any modifications we make to a string don't actually change that string but create an entirely new string
	So what the StringBuilder class does is give us a way to efficiently construct string values piece by piece. 
	So it has an append method that allows us to add content to the end of the string buffer and it has an insert method that allows us to insert content within the string buffer
	Now it's important to understand that StringBuilder itself is not a string. Once you build up the content that you're interested in, you need to extract the string from the StringBuilder instance and we do that by using StringBuilder's toString method
	You add size to StringBuilder to make it a little bit more efficient

9.2 - Understanding Time
	3 General categories of how we deal with time: time of events, local human friendly time, global human friendly time
	Tracking time of events - Instant class
		Optimized for time-stamping events

9.3 - Local and Global Date/Time
	LocalTime, LocalDate, LocalDateTime classes
	No aspect of time zones
	ZonedDateTime - operations similar to LocalDateTime but also understands time zones
		String time zone support. It knows when daylight saving time starts/ends

9.6 - Formatting Dates
	When we work with dates and time values, we often need to present them as strings or parse them from strings. But by default, each of the date and time types is limited to a single string format, which means that if we want to present any of those values in any format other than the default, we're goign to need some help
	That's where our DateTimeFormatter class comes in
